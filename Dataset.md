All of the speech files used for this project come from the Speech Accent Archive, a repository of spoken English hosted by George Mason University.
Over 2000 speakers representing over 100 native languages read a common elicitation paragraph in English:

     Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the store:
     Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
     We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. 
     he can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
    
The common nature of the dataset makes it ideal for studying accent, being that the wording is provided and the recording quality is (nearly) uniform across all speakers.
